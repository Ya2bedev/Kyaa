<p> Real friends build you up; fake friends just wait for you to fall."</p>
<p>Cross me once? You won’t get a second chance.</p>
<p>Snakes get stomped. Stay real or step off</p>
<p>You smile in my face? I see the knife in your back."</p>
<p>You’re just a two-faced snake, pretending to be a friend.</p>
<p>Fake friends are like shadows—always behind you <br> when the sun shines, but disappear in the dark</p>
<p>I’d rather your honesty than your performance.</p>
<p>Save the act for someone who’s still fooled.</p>
<p>Transparency or silence. Pick one.</p>
<p>Cut the shit or get cut off.</p>
<p>Your fakeness is loud. Mute yourself.</p>
<p>I don’t collect clowns. Bye.</p>
